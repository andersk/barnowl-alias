The Alias modules the ability to give aliases to long classnames for
display purposes ONLY. For example, I display `dirty-owl-hackers' as
`d-o-h'.

To use Alias, copy Alias.par into ~/.owl/modules, and create a
~/.owl/classmap file listing the (class, alias) pairs you want,
separated by whitespace. For example, my classmap file contains


--- CUT HERE ---
dirty-owl-hackers               d-o-h
--- END CUT ---

Then, from BarnOwl, execute the :reload-modules command.
